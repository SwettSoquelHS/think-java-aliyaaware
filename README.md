Think Java

This will be the repository you use to store the exercises you complete from Think Java. You will create a directory for each chapter you are working on, so for example, you will create a directory named `chapter2` (No spaces in directory names EVER for this class).

# Goals
1. Create a standard way to submit the work you do for readings.
2. Practice writing java programs from scratch.

# Steps
1. Clone this project on your machine.
   * Recall the steps from portfolio project
   * `git clone <url from the green button above>`
   * change directory, CD, into the directory created 
   * `git config user.name <user>`
   * `git config user.email <email>`
2. For each chapter, create a new directory, use lowercase
   * E.G. chapter2
3. Follow the directions of the exercise. 
4. Save your work.
5. Publish your work to github
   * git add .
   * git commit -m "adding <whatever it is you are adding>"
   * git push

If an exercise prompts you to write code but does not provide the name of the class, then you should create class with a name matching the exercise number.

For example, if there was an Exercise 10 and it required you to write a program that printed "I ride bikes!"
   * Create the class, Exercise10 (in the file Exercise10.java)
   * Create a `main` method and peform the task.
   * Refer to Chapter 1, 2 and your class notes if you need help.
